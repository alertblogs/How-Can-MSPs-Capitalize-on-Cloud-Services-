How Can MSPs Capitalize on Cloud Services?
========

 Managed service providers (MSPs) simplify IT for global organizations of all sizes — and cloud services present new opportunities that enable these service providers to grow their revenues. Now, let’s take a closer look at MSPs and how they can capitalize on cloud services.

How Do MSPs Support Global Organizations?

MSPs remotely manage global organizations’ IT infrastructure, and they deliver services to help organizations streamline their IT. In doing so, MSPs ensure organizations can focus on what’s most important — driving revenue growth.

There are three types of MSPs:

    Pure-Play: Manage IT services and help organizations keep their technology running
    Value-Added: Offer IT services to keep organizations’ technology running, as well as additional services to help organizations get the most value out of their technology
    Outsourced: Provide a full spectrum of high- and low-level IT services; outsourced MSPs usually use their own equipment from their own headquarters to deliver these services

There is no shortage of services provided by MSPs, either. Common managed services include:

    Communication: Consist of data, voice and video services that are often bundled into a single package
    Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): Include software applications owned and hosted by an MSP and sold on a subscription basis
    Data Analytics: Provide network data monitoring that enables organizations to transform data into relevant, actionable insights

MSPs are becoming exceedingly important to global organizations — and the worldwide managed services market shows no signs of slowing down any time soon.

Worldwide managed services market revenues are projected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.2% between 2017 and 2022, according to industry analyst Kenneth Research. In addition, these revenues could total nearly $253 billion by 2022.

How Can an MSP Distinguish Itself from the Competition?

Merely offering managed services is insufficient. The global managed services market is fierce, and today’s MSPs must allocate time and resources to learn about the market and identify growth opportunities. Fortunately, an MSP that understands the managed services market landscape is better equipped than others to thrive both now and in the future.

There are lots of things that an MSP can do to distinguish itself from industry rivals, including:

    Make a Plan: Prioritize a single industry and offer services tailored to this sector; then, an MSP can build out its clientele across myriad industries over time
    Engage with Prospects and Customers: Use blog posts, social networks and other online tools to educate and inform prospects and customers
    Become an Industry Expert: Perform audits against industry regulations to highlight the quality of managed services available

As an MSP grows, it should constantly search for ways to expand its services, too. That way, an MSP can continuously grow its revenues and expand globally.

Of course, finding the right offerings to provide is rarely simple. If an MSP incorporates cloud services into its portfolio, however, it could reap the benefits of this decision for years to come.

Why Should MSPs Offer Cloud Services?

A “cloud-first” strategy is quickly becoming a must-have for global organizations — and perhaps it is easy to understand why. There are many reasons why organizations leverage cloud offerings, including:

    Cost Savings: Reduce or eliminate the costs associated with managing and maintaining IT systems
    Flexibility: Enable organizations to provide fast, secure data access to workers around the world
    Business Continuity: Ensure organizations can protect their data and keep their critical systems running — even if a natural disaster or power outage occurs

The global public cloud services market is expected to be worth $214.3 billion this year and “grow exponentially” through 2022, technology research firm Gartner indicated. Meanwhile, Gartner also stated cloud is projected to be a $317 billion industry by 2022. And as a result, MSPs that integrate cloud services into their portfolios now may position themselves for long-lasting success.

How Can MSPs Deliver Cloud Services?

Building a cloud business may seem difficult for an MSP. But with the right partner at its disposal, an MSP can seamlessly incorporate cloud services into its portfolio and help customers optimize these services.

The ideal cloud services partner offers support in the following areas:

    Security: Uses built-in redundancies and constant backups and contingencies to prevent IT downtime and outages
    Integrations: Makes it simple to integrate cloud services into monitoring, chat and ticketing tools
    Incident Management: Automates major incident management and improves uptime

The Bottom Line on MSPs and Cloud Services 

Cloud services help global organizations accelerate their operations, lower their operating costs and drive growth and innovation. Yet these organizations often need experts to implement and manage cloud environments.

MSPs can deliver cloud services to help global organizations thrive. At the same time, MSPs must ensure cloud services surpass customer expectations. If an MSP finds the right cloud services partner, it can do just that — and more.
